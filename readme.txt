This a Simple Project for ESP32 and a Smartphone Android in this case.
The easiest way if you use PlatformIO.
The ESP Code makes random Values, it should not be a Problem to intercrate 
Install the App in D:\__Dokus\Documents\PlatformIO\ESP32\_BlueTooth\ESP32-BLE-Gauge\Thunkable\ESP32_Klima_App.aia

Change all you UUID with https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
In My case I use a sub Directory in my Web Access, for the HTML File Gauge.html
so you have the change this in MIT APP Inventer to create your own Project.
Have fun
